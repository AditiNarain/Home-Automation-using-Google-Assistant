# Home-Automation-using-Google-Assistant
## Abstract:
With advance technology developing nowadays we are mostly using smart appliances. So sitting at any place using our voice command as input we can controll the lights, fans or anything.In this IOT project we will be controlling our home appliance using the google assistant according to the message we have done coding and decoding.
### Components:
1.	Ultrasonic Sensor
2.	Arduino UNO
3.	Buzzer
4.	LCD
5.	Potentiometer (For Brightness of  LCD) 

### About Component:
   â€¢ Ultrasonic Sensor:About Pins:
Trigger pin will send High State for 10 ms and the 8 sonic sound which is received by echo pin.Echo Pin will be responsible for calculating time by that time will be double as time from transmitting the sound to bouncing back. So we will take half time for calculating 
distance.

Working:
When the ultrasound transmitted from trigger strikes on 
the object and bounces back to echo. This way we calculate 
the total time.
From time and speed of sound which is 340m/s we can 
calculate the distance of the object from the sensor.   
                           Distance=Speed X Time   
Buzzer:Operating Voltage 3 to 8V.
Buzzer has 2 pins (Ground, Power).Inside the cylindrical buzzer there is a piezo element. When a power given to buzzer then the ceramic disc inside the piezo elements start vibrating. Hence creating a sound
If we apply different frequency to the buzzer from pwm pins then it vibration changes making different beep sound or a tone

  
### Circuit Diagram:




### Working: 

### Program Logic:
        For measurind distace of the object from sesnor.
	Trigger pin high for 10ms
	Trigger pin low. to detect the signal at echo
 	
 	time=pulseIn(echo,HIGH);
 	distance=time*34/2000;
 	float d=distance/100;

      For indication to the car when to stop the car.

  	 if(d<2)
    	      print("stop")
	 else if(d>=2&&d<=3)
                           print("move slowly")
	 else if(d>3)
                           print("MOVE BACK");
